# [Project 4: Fan Sentiment Analysis of the Las Vegas Raiders Following the 2022 Benching of Derek Carr for Jarrett Stidham](https://github.com/ebrodbeck/Raiders_Fan_Sentiment)
- Following a disapointing week 15 loss to the Steelers, the Raiders decided to bench 9-year veteran QB and topic of controversy, Derek Carr. In week 16, the Raiders started backup QB Jarrett Stidham against the eventual NFC Championship runner-up 49ers. Despite a narrow 37-34 overtime loss, Stidham posted an impressive stat line and the future of the Raiders QB position became an interesting conversation. A fan sentiment poll posted to Reddit's r/Raiders forum yielded an interesting dataset, allowing for correlations between future outlook at the QB position and prior sentiments regarding Derek Carr.

### Fan sentiment immediately after Derek Carr was benched:
